The following repo is a package created in R which contains the implementations of the Dijkstra and Euclidean algorithms. 


To install the package: 

install_github("Siddhesh19991/Dijkstra-and-euclidean-Algorithm-") 


Here's a brief explanation of Dijkstra's and Euclidean algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm:

• Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.  <br>
• Uses a priority queue to iteratively explore nodes from a source, updating shortest paths.  <br>

Euclidean Algorithm:

• Finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.  <br>
• Repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero, using the principle that the GCD divides their difference.  <br>
